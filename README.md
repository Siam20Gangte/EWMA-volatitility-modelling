# EWMA-volatitility-modelling
# Time Series Analysis of NIFTY index. 

The simplest way possible to predict volatility for t+1 using EWMA. Prerequisite knowledge is volatility/ standard deviation formula. Trust me, understanding std.dev formula and being able to calculate it mechanically goes a long way in quant finance. Out of which branches out even more complex models like ARCH, GARCH

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing the volatility of TSLA stock using time series analysis. The script uses the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) method to estimate the volatility of the stock.


# Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to have the pandas and numpy libraries installed. If you don't have these libraries installed, you can install them using the following commands:


pip install pandas
pip install numpy


# Usage
To use the script, simply run it in a Python environment. The script reads the TSLA stock data from a CSV file, which is included in this repository. The script calculates the volatility of the stock using the EWMA method and prints the result to the console.
